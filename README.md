# nomsh
A shell written in C, implementing the lab <href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/labs/lab-shell/shell.pdf">"Building a Shell"</href>.

Currently supports the following commands:
* cd
* cwd
* echo
* help
* exit

Compile the file named "shell.c":

`
cd src
gcc shell.c -o shell
`

Start the shell:

`
./shell
`

Functionalities for other commands will be added. Come back in some time.
